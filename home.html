    <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h1>
    <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business? </h2>

    <p>   With Technology a business will get help in understanding its cash flow needs and will save its important resources. Warehouse inventory technologies let businesses manage the storage costs of holding a product. Meetings can be held online to save time and money. IT has big impacts on business operations. Doesn't matter if your business is big or small, technology has all types of benefits that will help you increase profits and get you the results your consumers are after. IT foundation will keep your confidential information secure.
        </p>
   <h1>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
        </h1>
        
        <p>Project management combined with technology is Digital Project Management. Resources and methods required depends upon the type of project you are dealing with. Resources that I normally use are Trello, Slack, Google Drive, Google Docs, they all have different useful aspects and they play an equally important part in completing the project. With Trello you can do a Kanban board which helps you organise the project, it shows you clearly what needs doing, what you are doing and what's done, which makes things a lot easier so you know what you are upto and it helps all the members of the project to keep up to date with what's happening and what they need to do, doesn't matter which part of the world they are in. Trello is a must have tool for organising a project. On the other hand slack help us to stay in touch with all the members of the project, you can call each other and can share links and files, so everyone can access it. Google drive was also helpful with storing big files online. Google docs was perfect if more than one person is contributing to a document it updates and save changes regularly and quickly so there's hardly any chances of you losing your work.
        </p>

    <h1>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your troll board. </h1>
    
    <p>planning can be done easily with the use of Trello, as you can use kanban method to see what needs doing, what's being done and what is done. You can make different lists, have separate cards for different tasks which can be labelled in different colours so you can differentiate between them easily. And if you are working in a team you can assign different tasks to different people by tagging them in the cards you want them to give their attention to. You can set up deadlines and Trello will remind you before the deadline is due date and time. This is the link for my Trello Board for Web project.

    <h1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
    </h1>
    
    <p>There are so many reasons a digital project can fail. Having all the resources but not having certain skills can have a big impact like introducing hitech systems but not having staff trained for it or simply not having enough staff to manage it will have a negative impact on the business so instead of improvement this will bring the decline. Even if you start training them after so much struggle and massive training you might have to scrap the whole project so it'll end up as a waste of time and money.
    </p>

    <h1>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  </h1>
    
    <p>Before starting a new project the first thing to consider is to choose the right technology for the project. And in order to do that you will have to look at the requirements for that project like what's needed and how you want your project to turn out. If we suppose we want to build a website then we have to first think of how we want our website to look and whats the content structure. So we will have to see if we need to install any tools to help us with our project. You will have to consider the server side of it, what's best suited for the type of website you are trying to build, if its a massive project with a heavy design and load then its worth looking at some of the faster servers so it won't make your website slow. You will have to decide if you want to stick with javascript or use server side rendering using MVC or an all-in-one CMS. CMS will make sure your website is up and running in no time. Deciding what sort of template you want to use with your website. </p>

    <h1>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
    </h1>
    
    <p>Trello helped me alot to manage my project, i had a clear indication of what needed to do, what I was doing and what was done. I was able to set certain goals of what I should do and for how long, having deadlines helped me as I was reminded in time from trello when I was near my deadline to finish my work and review it. A version control system of github tracks the history of changes while a team is working on projects together. As the project develops, you can run tests, fix issues, and add new code knowing that any version can be recovered at any time. You can check the project history to see what changes were done, who did the change and when and why they did it.</p>

    <h1>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h1>
    
    <p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) GDPR impact digital marketing in three ways that's consent, data access and data processing. it will be easier for an individual to withdraw his consent for data processing. So making it clear for people to withdraw their consent at anytime and must be easier for them to do that as it was to give their consent. Digital marketers will only be able to process the limited amount of data they really need, they will be required to have legal justification for why the personal data they've collected is being processed, because of this digital projects will be limited to what can be tried and tested. These limitations will have a big impact on digital projects.</p>

    <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review)</h1>

    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h2>
    
    <p>In this day and age there's a huge amount of IT tools available online to use. I like visual studio because i can create different types of files very easily. Trello is good for managing your time more efficiently, it gives you clear indications of what needs doing, what you are doing and what's done. So I was happy with the tools I had to use, visual studio being the best out of all. I did like Trello but as i am just getting familiar with using Trello so because of that i didn't find it easier to use. I would have liked to use Trello more efficiently and could have utilised its ability to organise my project a lot better. Codepen was very helpful as I was able to see other peoples work and how they did it, it gave me so many different ideas which were very helpful in creating my website. Codepen has so much data that you can go through them all day and will be filled with great ideas at the end of the day. Codepen has to be my favourite.</p>

    <h1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h1>
    
    <p>The tools I selected were very helpful as I was able to finish my project with ease especially Visual Studio and Trello. Visual Studio was used to do coding, I used HTML, CSS and Trello to manage my time efficiently by using Kanban method. I also used Codepen website to get some great ideas and used some of the codes shared by community there to modernise my blog. So codepen has to be my favourite as you can see different types of projects by different people and they are amazing, I never got bored of going looking at different codes. I used a code from codepen and made different changes to it so it can fit in my website, I found it interesting as I was able to make different adjustments to the code and saw changes and i kept on tweaking it until i was fully happy with the outcome and used it for my website.</p>

    <h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h1>
    
    <p>Strength would be the content of the website, all the researched material that was used and especially the welcome page of my website which I am very satisfied with. And weakness would be not using much javascript on the website and I would have liked to add more pages on my website. I would have liked to have more time to play around with different settings inside the html and css to see different results and picked the ones I was more satisfied with. I kept my website simple so it's easier to navigate and get to where you want to. I like the colour scheme of my website. Another weakness would be its not compatible with mobile phones, so you can’t open this website on a mobile device. I would have liked to make it compatible with different types of phones.
    </p>

    <h1>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  </h1>
    
    <p>I can use javascript to do some cool effects. I need more practice with that as I am not that good with javascript yet but if i was i would have been able to make it look more tech oriented. Because of the lack of the time i couldn’t experiment with the javascript. I wanted to make 3d images to see different types of layouts. It would have been nice to create different types of effects when you click on something, like a splash of water coming out of a button when you click it. I would have liked to spend more time on codepen to check out more public codes shared on that and be able to implement them to my website to see the effects and improvements they would have brought to my website.</p>

    <h1>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose  </h1>
    
    <p>Preparing specific content for the website was the main task. Then testing the website for errors. First I used a different font it was beautiful looking but it was difficult to read and had to make sure I was applying a font that’s easily readable so i had to change that to a different font so that it can be read. I also had to change some of the file formats for the documents to display on the website properly. I made sure I had error free pages and they were fit for purpose. Making sure all the links worked, and all the buttons did what they were intended to do. I wanted to keep it simple, so I kept one page for the course work and made unit 1 and unit 2 button in the nav bar and linked them to where the start of each section is so when you click on them it scrolls down to the exact location you suppose to go to.</p>

    <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) </h1>
    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    
    <p>Benefits of IT are vast, like you can send and receive messages instantly and free of cost and if you want to send the same message to more than one person you can do that at once instead of sending it individually that saves a lot of time. If you are stuck you can ask people for help. You can send screenshots of your work to get suggestions and to have another person’s opinion on what you are doing right or wrong and how you can make your work better. If we look at the drawbacks then when you are sending messages it's not face to face so no expressions can be used and sometimes you can convey your message the way you wanted to. While using IT systems you can easily be distracted and can end up going away from your work onto social media scrolling through news feeds or watching random videos hence wasting your time and not been able to complete your project in time. I could have used Trello better. If i had a team that would have been great as we would have had a mixture of skills and could have easily distribute tasks according to the strengths of different individuals to take advantage of their capabilities.</p>

    <h1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </h1>
    
    <p>Using Trello is the best way to improve productivity as you can use kanban method which will clearly indicate you what needs doing, what’s being done and what’s already done. That keeps you updated with your project progression whether you are working alone or in a team. While working in a team you can assign different tasks to different team members and see what everyones upto. Slack can be used to send messages instantly and you can share files with your team quickly. While working in a team you can assign different tasks to different members of the team according to their expertise so that work can be done quickly and more efficiently. You can use cloud storage to keep your work safe incase your system becomes faulty. So using something like google drive is really beneficial.</p>

    <h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h1>
    
    <p>I would like to use Trello better next time so i can utilise the full benefit of it as its my early experience of using it so I am not good enough to make the best use of it. I would definitely prefer team work as you can get different insights on your project which gives you more ideas to make your project better. In future i can learn more about javascript and can implement different functions onto my website to give it more professional and sleek look. In future if I am working in a team Slack is a must have tool to stay in touch with each other and to send important files and content over to the whole team or individually, which is very beneficial for the project.</p>

    <h1>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions  </h1>
    
    <p>I would ask some of my tech driven amazing friends to do some testing for me as user testing is the most important part of any project as I will be presenting it to unbiased eyes to get their opinion and suggestions for the betterment and improvement of the project. I can test it on different platforms, if its a website I can test it on different browsers like safari, internet explorer, google chrome, firefox, opera etc to make sure its compatible with them and what I can do to make the functionality and look of the website better.</p>

    <h1 id="b">Unit 2: Website Software (Outcome 1)</h1>
    <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
    
    <p>I thought about having a welcome page instead of going straight onto the website home page. So as you know first impression is the last impression, I wanted to make it appealing and eye catching which i am really satisfied with. So the welcome screen got a video playing in the background in a loop with text displaying in white colour font so it can be seen clearly and when you click on “Click Here” it takes you straight to the homepage of the website. Homepage of the website has got tomato colour top part, it says my name at the top then a welcome message, underneath that it has links for my Github and twitter account and is consisting of a title bar with different clickable buttons, when you click them they take you to the desired location. It also have a Home button to take you back to the home page after you click on it.</p>

    <h1>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h1>
    
    <p>Copyright is one of the main types of intellectual property. Intellectual property allows a person to own things they create in the same way as something physical can be owned. It is the right to prevent others copying or reproducing someone's work. Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way of getting around this is getting permission from the original author to use the content. As a general rule, have the assumption that all works are protected by either copyright or trademark law unless there are clear indications that it isn't. This creates limitations on what can be achieved by using someones great design or an idea.</p>

    <h1>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them  </h1>
    
    <p>We have to consider the accessibility for people with disabilities, how we can make our website accessible to more people out there. If someone is colourblind we can implement a colour scheme that's more friendly for colourblind people, Make sure colours and fonts contrast sufficiently. Provide a skip links option to let a user skip content that is repetitive. Try to use simple language on your website. Screen reader will be helpful for someone who's blind as they dont use mouse as it needs hands and eyes coordination, they use keyboard so having a screen reader helps them and when they have to click on something they press the enter key. So keeping all that in mind while creating your website is important so everyone can use your website with ease.
    </p>

    <h1>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites  </h1>
    
    <p>It all depends on what sort of website you are working on, I will talk about some of the file types here first one is 
      .CSS — Cascading StyleSheet, CSS files take care of how websites look. CSS files can be created or edited in any text-editor like Notepad. I created and used .css filetype on visual studio during this website project of mine for designing purpose. 
      .DOC — Microsoft Word Document, Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them. 
      .EXE — EXEcutable file, If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file. 
      .GIF — Graphics Interchange Format, The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images.
      .HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file, Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files. I used .html filetype to write the code for the website.
      .JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file, Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos. Most of the images I used on my website had .jpg format.
      .PNG — Portable Network Graphics, PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support.
      I used .jpg file format for background images, i used .mp4 format for the background video i used for the welcome page. I also used .js file type for javascript.

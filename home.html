    Unit 1: Improving productivity with IT 
    Unit 1, Outcome 1 
    
    1.1  With Technology a business will get help in understanding its cash flow needs and will save its important resources. Warehouse inventory technologies let businesses manage the storage costs of holding a product. Meetings can be held online to save time and money.
    IT has big impacts on business operations. Doesn't matter if your business is big or small, technology has all types of benefits that will help you increase profits and get you the results your consumers are after. IT foundation will keep your confidential information secure.

    1.2  Project management combined with technology is Digital Project Management. Resources and methods required depends upon the type of project you are dealing with. Resources that I normally use are Trello, Slack, Google Drive, Google Docs, they all have different useful aspects and they play an equally important part in completing the project. With Trello you can do a Kanban board which helps you organise the project, it shows you clearly what needs doing, what you are doing and what's done, which makes things a lot easier so you know what you are upto and it helps all the members of the project to keep up to date with what's happening and what they need to do, doesnt matter which part of the world they are in. Trello is a must have tool for organising a project. On the other hand slack help us to stay in touch with all the members of the project, you can call each other and can share links and files, so everyone can access it. Google drive was also helpful with storing big files online. Google docs was perfect if more than one person is contributing to a document it updates and save changes regularly and quickly so there's hardly any chances of you losing your work.

    1.3 planning can be done easily with the use of Trello, as you can use kanban method to see what needs doing, what's being done and what is done. This is the link for my Trello Board for Web project.

        1.4 There are so many reasons a digital project can fail. Having all the resources but not having certain skills can have a big impact like introducing hitech systems but not having staff trained for it or simply not having enough staff to manage it will have a negative impact on the business so instead of improvement this will bring the decline. Even if you start training them after so much struggle and massive training you might have to scrap the whole project so it'll end up as a waste of time and money.

    1.5  Before starting a new project the first thing to consider is to choose the right technology for the project. And in order to do that you will have to look at the requirements for that project like what's needed and how you want your project to turn out. If we suppose we want to build a website then we have to first think of how we want our website to look and whats the content structure. So we will have to see if we need to install any tools to help us with our project. You will have to consider the server side of it, what's best suited for the type of website you are trying to build, if its a massive project with a heavy design and load then its worth looking at some of the faster servers so it won't make your website slow. You will have to decide if you want to stick with javascript or use server side rendering using MVC or an all-in-one CMS. CMS will make sure your website is up and running in no time. Deciding what sort of template you want to use with your website.

    1.6 Trello helped me alot to manage my project, i had a clear indication of what needed to do, what I was doing and what was done. I was able to set certain goals of what I should do and for how long, having deadlines helped me as I was reminded in time from trello when I was near my deadline to finish my work and review it. A version control system of github tracks the history of changes while a team is working on projects together. As the project develops, you can run tests, fix issues, and add new code knowing that any version can be recovered at any time. You can check the project history to see what changes were done, who did the change and when and why they did it.

    1.7 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) GDPR impact digital marketing in three ways that's consent, data access and data processing. it will be easier for an individual to withdraw his consent for data processing. So making it clear for people to withdraw their consent at anytime and must be easier for them to do that as it was to give their consent.

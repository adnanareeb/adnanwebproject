            <p>My name is Adnan Aslam, I am 34 years old. I was always interested in electronics. Always wanted to learn how these things work, I use to open old devices at home to see what was inside them. This is a step towards the right direction doing something I always wanted to do, so learning programming is my passion and I can't wait to learn it and be able to experiment with different skills that I will acquire from the course I am doing through Code Nation. This place is amazing it fulfils your dreams. I found everyone very friendly and helpful here. This has helped me to build my confidence level and I am feeling great and gaining a lot of knowledge.
